## What is left to download into Box?
*Update this file to reflect changes!*

[NASA conducted](https://workshops.larc.nasa.gov/RAM_Fog_Test/) 13 baseline tests, 25 fog tests, and 2 public affairs office (PAO) tests. There is data for 9 baseline, 18 fog, and 1 PAO test.

In the box folder, we currently have:
- All 9 baseline tests **unzipped** (01, 02, 03, 04, 07, 08, 09, 11, 12)
- 2 fog tests **unzipped** (01, 16)
- 4 fog tests **zipped** (02, 03, 04, 09)
- 1 PAO test **zipped** (02)

This means we still have:
- 0 baseline, 12 fog, and 0 PAO tests to **download their zipped folders from the NASA site** (06, 08, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 17, 18, 20, 22, 24)
- 0 baseline, 16 fog, and 1 PAO test to **unzip** (the above to-be-downloaded tests plus fog02, fog02, fog04, fog09, and pao02)

A big issue is that downloading and unzipping these files use up the memory of the local computer. Box *does* upload the files to the cloud and free up local computer memory, but the fact remains that these files require local memory, even for just a temporary amount of time.

For example, let's say a computer has 20 GB of free storage left and there is one 16 GB file and another 10 GB file to download. Obviously, the computer cannot download both files at the same time, but they could download the first file (and have 4 GB free memory remaining). Then, *after Box uploads the now-downloaded file to the cloud*, the computer will have 20 GB of free storage again, and *now* the second file can be downloaded. In short, this may have to be a rather time-intensive process.
