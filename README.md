## What is left to download into Box?
*Update this file to reflect changes!*
[NASA conducted](https://workshops.larc.nasa.gov/RAM_Fog_Test/) 13 baseline tests, 25 fog tests, and 2 public affairs office (PAO) tests. There is data for 9 baseline, 18 fog, and 1 PAO test.

In the box folder, we currently have:
- All 9 baseline tests **unzipped** (01, 02, 03, 04, 07, 08, 09, 11, 12)
- 2 fog tests **unzipped** (01, 16)
- 4 fog tests **zipped** (02, 03, 04, 09)
- 1 PAO test **zipped** (02)

This means we still have:
- 0 baseline, 12 fog, and 0 PAO tests to **download their zipped folders from the NASA site** (06, 08, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 17, 18, 20, 22, 24)
- 0 baseline, 16 fog, and 1 PAO test to **unzip** (the above to-be-downloaded tests plus fog02, fog02, fog04, fog09, and pao02)
